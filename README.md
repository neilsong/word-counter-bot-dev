# word-counter-bot
Python Discord Bot for counting words

**A Discord bot that analyzes the word choice of users on the server**

A bot that will analyze syntax/word choice of everyone in this server

  1. Provide insight and analytics into the unique language of this server
        - Leaderboard of most common words in the server
        - Your own personal leaderboard of most common words

  2. (Possibly) Create an AI model that will mimic your style to send a message you would probably send on command

  3. (Very far off/might not even happen) Create a web app that serves a dashboard with insights, charts, and analytics
